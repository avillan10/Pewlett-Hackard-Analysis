# Module 7: Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis / Employee Database with SQL

## Purpose: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Our boss has give us the task of determining the number of retiring employees per title and identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, we are to write a report that summarizes our analysis and help prepare our manager for the “silver tsunami”-- when current employees reach their retirement age.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
- About 60% of the reitiring titles are SENIOR ENGINEERS AND SENIOR STAFF.  
- According to the data analysis--SENIOR ENGINEERS AND SENIOR STAFF positions are the top high priority items that need to be fulfilled. 
- Among all the retirees, there are 1,550 employees that are eligible for the mentorship program. 
- There is a higher count of people retiring versus the potential mentors count, meaning that the company would have to create a program that can cover the disparity between the two variables. 

Here is a screen capture of the retiring titles.
